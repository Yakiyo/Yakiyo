## Just your average weeb. 

I read Light Novels and mangas and occassionally watch animes.

Currently learning more of Javascript on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and *trying* to make a [discord bot](https://github.com/Yakiyo/Yume-Bot)

I'm in high school right now and am aspiring to become a web developer (if i can)
